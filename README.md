# ***Library Club***

## *About:*

A compact web service that allows to work with 'authors' and 'books'.

Technologies used:
- Django: user-friendly interface of project;
- Django Rest Framework (DRF): allows to easily create a REST API of project;
- Swagger: allows anyone to visualize and interact with the APIâ€™s resources.  

The main features that have currently been implemented are:

1. There are models for books and authors.
2. The **"Books"** section displays a table of all books from the database. Using the key **"Add book"**, the user can independently add a book to the section.
